						<h2>Glass Packaging Production</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="mod-titletext__text">	
						<p>At Ciner Glass, our production method follows a several step process:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Blending: Glass Packaging is produced using natural raw materials such as Silica Sand, Soda, Dolomite, Limestone and Glass Cullet. The blend is prepared by mixing the natural raw materials in the above-mentioned proportions with the help of mixers. <br />The blend is then sent to the furnaces to be melted.</li>
							<li>Furnace: The Mixture and Glass Crumb are raised up to 1550°C and melted in furnaces using natural gas and electricity, which consists of refractory structures, and the melted glass is cooled under control and sent to the Forming Machines at around 1200°C.</li>
							<li>Shaping: The molten glass received from the furnace is given its final shape by using one of the BB (Blow-Blow), PB (Press-Blow), NNPB (Narrow Neck Pres-Blow) techniques in moulds previously produced according to the bottle shape. Glass packaging coming out of the moulds is transferred to the Annealing Furnace passing through the Hot Coating unit at 600°C.</li>
							<li>Hot plating and Annealing Furnace: The hot coating process is applied to glass packages immediately after forming machines. The purpose of this process is to close the micro-cracks in the bottles and create a primer for the Cold Coating process that will be applied after the annealing furnace. During forming, glass packages are loaded with undesirable tensions that reduce their strength as they cool suddenly and uncontrollably. Annealing furnaces are used in order to eliminate the resulting stresses (tension) by controlled cooling (annealing).</li>
							<li>Cold Coating: Glass packages can be scratched by touching each other as they move along the lines. These scratches can have a negative effect on the strength of the bottle. In order to prevent these scratches, a water-based food-grade cold coating liquid is applied to the contact areas on the outer surface of the glass packages.</li>
							<li>Controls:  At Ciner Glass, we implement the following three control protocols: 
								<ul>
									<li>Glass packages with cold coating liquid are subjected to various controls and tests by sampling method (visual control, gauge control, pressure and impact control).</li>
									<li>All of the products coming from the forming are passed through the latest technology defect separation machines for the head, bottom, side surface, crack, mouth sealing and narrow neck control.</li>
									<li>Samples are taken from the products that pass through the defect sorting machines, final visual controls are made by both online machines and operators, and they are sent to the packaging after the approval of the quality department.</li>
									<li>At the same time, faulty glass packages are discarded and recycled in order to feed them back into the furnace.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Packaging: Glass packaging products approved by the Quality Control Team are then packaged and delivered to the warehouse with the help of conveyors, ready for shipment.</li>
							<li>Storage: The Glass packaging products are transported to specially designed warehouses for safe delivery to our customers.</li>

						<h2>Sustainability</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="mod-titletext__text">
						<p>At Ciner Glass, we are ready to create a more sustainable future for the glass industry.</p>

						<p>Our glass is a high-tech environmentally friendly product, and its recycling capabilities give glass an advantage compared to 
						the other type of containers. The use of glass will need to grow exponentially to provide a real solution to reducing the amount 
						of single-use plastic across the globe. This is where we believe our glass plant production can help produce millions of 100% recyclable glass bottles every year.</p>

						<p>Our target to reach net zero has already started. As a company, we have pledged to increase the percentage of recycled glass used year after year, with the ultimate aim of using over 300,000 tons of recycled glass annually.</p>

						<p>By using sustainable construction materials, local suppliers and recycled glass – requiring lower energy consumption in the facility – we can drastically reduce emissions. Currently, too many glass bottles are dumped into landfills, and we will ensure that our glass products will be reused.</p>

						<p>We have a proven track record of innovation, already producing one of the lightest bottles in the UK. We know that glass is the sustainable industry of tomorrow and believe that we can start to build a sustainable future for the industry.</p>
